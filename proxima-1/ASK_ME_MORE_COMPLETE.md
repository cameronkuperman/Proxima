- Shows additional questions count (X of 5)
- Progress messages in chat
- Clear success/limitation messages

### 3. User Experience Flow

#### Successful Flow (Reaches Target):
1. User at 70% â†’ Clicks "Ask Me More"
2. Answers 2-3 additional questions
3. Reaches 90% confidence
4. "ðŸŽ¯ Excellent! We've reached 90% confidence"
5. Auto-generates enhanced report

#### Limited Flow (Max Questions):
1. User at 70% â†’ Clicks "Ask Me More"
2. Answers 5 additional questions
3. Reaches 85% (below 90% target)
4. "Maximum additional questions reached"
5. "ðŸ’¡ Tip: Try Ultra Think for higher confidence"
6. Still generates report with 85% confidence

### 4. Both Entry Points Working
âœ… **In Chat**: "Ask Me More" button appears with "Generate Analysis"
âœ… **In Results**: "Ask Me More" button shows when confidence < 90%

## Key Response Handlers

```typescript
// When questions continue
if (result.question) {
  // Show new question
  // Update progress
  // Re-enable chat
}

// When max reached but target not met
else if (result.should_finalize) {
  // Show max reached message
  // Suggest Ultra Think
  // Auto-complete after delay
}

// When target reached
else if (result.message?.includes('achieved')) {
  // Show success message
  // Auto-complete with high confidence
}
```
