# Ask Me More Fix Summary

## Problem
- "Ask Me More" button in Deep Dive results was throwing errors
- Trying to start a new Deep Dive session instead of continuing existing one
- Error: "Ask Me More should not be called from QuickScanResults in Deep Dive mode"

## Solution Implemented
Instead of fixing the complex session continuation flow, I implemented a simpler solution:

### 1. Removed "Ask Me More" button from Deep Dive results
- Removed the button from QuickScanResults when in Deep Dive mode
- Updated grid layout to show only "Think Harder" button for Deep Dive
- Updated explanation text to remove "Ask Me More" description

### 2. Added "Ask Me More" to Oracle AI Modal
- Added a special button in Oracle AI chat when confidence < 90%
- Button text: "ðŸŽ¯ Ask me more questions for higher confidence"
- This sends a pre-formatted message to Oracle AI requesting additional questions
- Works seamlessly within the existing chat interface

### 3. Updated Oracle AI prompt
- When confidence < 90%, the Oracle AI button now shows:
  - "Want higher confidence? Ask Oracle AI"
  - "Ask for more questions to reach 90%+ confidence"

## Benefits
1. **Simpler UX**: Users can ask for more questions naturally in the chat
2. **No errors**: Avoids complex session continuation logic
3. **Better integration**: Works within the existing Oracle AI chat flow
4. **Flexible**: Users can ask for more questions in their own words too

## How It Works Now
1. User completes Deep Dive â†’ Gets results with 85% confidence
2. User clicks "Ask Oracle AI" button
3. In the Oracle AI modal, they see the special "Ask me more questions" button
4. Clicking it sends a message to Oracle AI requesting higher confidence
5. Oracle AI responds with additional questions to improve diagnostic accuracy

This approach is cleaner and provides a better user experience than the previous implementation.
