# Ask Me More - Implementation Proposal

## What "Ask Me More" Actually Does

Based on the backend API (`/api/deep-dive/ask-more`):
- Takes an existing Deep Dive session that's completed at ~85% confidence
- Continues asking targeted medical questions to reach 90-95% confidence
- It's NOT for general questions - it's specifically for increasing diagnostic accuracy
- Backend tracks the session and generates follow-up questions based on previous answers

## Current Situation
- Deep Dive typically completes at 85% confidence after 2-6 questions
- Users might want higher confidence for serious symptoms
- The endpoint exists and works, but needs proper UI integration

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Keep It in Results + Fix Implementation ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Where**: Deep Dive Results page (QuickScanResults component)
**How**: 
```
[Deep Dive Results Page]
├── Confidence: 85%
├── Think Harder Button (Grok 4)
├── Ask Me More Button (to 90%+) ← Continues session
└── Ask Oracle Button (general questions)
```

**Implementation**:
- When clicked, navigate back to Deep Dive Chat with `continueSession` flag
- Deep Dive Chat detects continuation and calls `askMeMore` endpoint
- Shows new questions in the same chat interface
- After answering additional questions, returns to results with updated confidence

**Pros**:
- Clear user intent - "I want higher confidence"
- Maintains session context
- Natural flow: Results → More Questions → Better Results

**Cons**:
- Requires navigation between pages
- More complex state management

### Option 2: Add to Deep Dive Chat After Completion
**Where**: In the Deep Dive Chat itself, after showing "Generate Analysis" button
**How**:
```
[Deep Dive Chat]
├── Q&A Messages
├── "Ready for analysis!"
├── [Generate Analysis] button
└── [Ask Me More for 90%+ Confidence] button ← New
```

**Implementation**:
- After backend returns `ready_for_analysis`, show both buttons
- "Ask Me More" calls the endpoint and continues in same chat
- "Generate Analysis" completes as normal

**Pros**:
- No navigation needed
- Stays in conversation context
- User can decide before seeing results

**Cons**:
- User doesn't know current confidence level yet
- Might not realize they need higher confidence

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach 
**Where**: Both places with different triggers
**How**:
1. In Chat: Show after `ready_for_analysis` as optional path
2. In Results: Show when confidence < 90% as enhancement option

**Pros**:
- Multiple entry points
- User can decide at different stages
- Most flexible

**Cons**:
- More complex to implement
- Potential confusion about which to use

### Option 4: Smart Auto-Prompt
**Where**: Deep Dive Chat
**How**:
- If confidence would be < 85%, automatically offer more questions
- "I can achieve higher diagnostic confidence with a few more questions. Would you like to continue?"

**Pros**:
- Proactive UX
- Prevents low-confidence results

**Cons**:
- Might feel pushy
- Users might want quick results

## What I DON'T Recommend

### ❌ Oracle AI Modal Only
- Oracle AI is for open-ended questions about the diagnosis
- Ask Me More is for structured confidence improvement
- These serve different purposes and shouldn't be mixed

## My Recommendation: Option 1 with Improvements

1. **Fix the Results Page Button** (like you originally wanted)
   - Clean up the navigation flow
   - Pass proper session continuation params
   - Make Deep Dive Chat handle continuations smoothly

2. **Add Visual Indicator**
   ```
   Current: 85% ──────●───── 95% Target
                      ↑
                 [Ask Me More]
   ```

3. **Clear Messaging**
   - "Get to 90%+ confidence with 2-3 more questions"
   - "Recommended for serious or persistent symptoms"

## Implementation Plan

If you agree with Option 1:

1. **Fix `handleAskMeMore` in QuickScanResults**
   - Properly pass session ID
   - Navigate to Deep Dive Chat with continuation flag

2. **Update Deep Dive Chat**
   - Detect `continueSession` parameter
   - Call `askMeMore` endpoint instead of starting new session
   - Show returned questions
   - Allow completion to updated results

3. **Add Progress Indicator**
   - Show confidence progression
   - Indicate how many more questions expected

## Questions for You

1. Do you prefer Option 1 (Results page) or Option 2 (In chat)?
2. Should it automatically suggest "Ask Me More" if confidence < 85%?
3. Want a visual confidence meter showing progress?
4. Should there be a limit (e.g., max 5 additional questions)?

Let me know which approach you prefer and I'll implement it properly!
