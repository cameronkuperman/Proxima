- [x] All errors now return generic messages with error codes
- [x] Updated critical API routes (`/api/timeline`, `/api/test-user`)
- [x] Created test script to verify no data leaks
- [x] Server-side logging preserved for debugging
**Note**: Frontend functionality unchanged - it already handles errors properly

### 7. ~~No Input Validation~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**Severity**: ~~HIGH~~ RESOLVED  
**Location**: ~~All API endpoints~~ Critical endpoints now protected  
**Issue**: ~~No input validation on user-provided data~~ Now validated with Zod  
**Risk**: ~~SQL injection, XSS, data corruption~~ Mitigated  
**Action Completed**:
- [x] Implemented input validation using Zod
- [x] Created validation schemas for timeline API (GET/POST)
- [x] All inputs sanitized and validated before processing
- [x] Protects against:
  - SQL injection attempts (blocked by enum validation)
  - Invalid data types (strings, numbers, UUIDs)
  - Out-of-range values (limits, negative numbers)
  - Oversized inputs (string length limits)
- [x] Created test suite to verify validation
- [x] No breaking changes - valid requests work exactly the same
