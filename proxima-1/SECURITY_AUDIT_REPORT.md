### 12. ~~Frontend Configuration Review~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**Severity**: ~~MEDIUM~~ RESOLVED  
**Issue**: ~~Need to verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are appropriate for frontend exposure~~ All frontend variables verified as safe  
**Action Completed**:
- [x] Reviewed all `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables - all are safe for frontend:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Public project URL (safe)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Designed to be public with RLS (safe)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_API_URL` - Backend API URL (safe)
- [x] Confirmed Supabase anon key is meant to be public (protected by Row Level Security)
- [x] Verified no sensitive operations rely on frontend config alone
- [x] Confirmed sensitive keys (like GEMINI_API_KEY) are NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
**Note**: The GEMINI_API_KEY is correctly kept server-side only (no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)

### 13. ~~No Content Security Policy~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**Severity**: ~~MEDIUM~~ RESOLVED  
**Issue**: ~~No CSP headers configured~~ CSP is fully configured in next.config.ts  
**Risk**: ~~XSS attacks, unauthorized script execution~~ Mitigated  
**Action Completed**:

- [x] Blocked dangerous sources:
  - object-src: 'none' (no plugins)
  - frame-ancestors: 'none' (prevent clickjacking)
  - base-uri: 'self' (prevent base tag injection)
**Note**: This was already resolved as part of issue #2 (Security Headers)

### 14. ~~BioDigital Integration Security~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**Severity**: ~~MEDIUM~~ RESOLVED  
**Location**: BioDigital iframe implementation  
**Issue**: ~~Loading external content without proper sandboxing~~ Security measures implemented

  - BioDigitalHosted.tsx - Test page
- [x] Messages only accepted from same origin (prevents cross-site attacks)
- [x] Domain restrictions already configured in BioDigital admin panel
**Note**: Sandbox attribute not added to preserve full BioDigital functionality. Origin validation provides sufficient security when combined with domain restrictions.

### 15. ~~No HTTPS Enforcement~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**Severity**: ~~MEDIUM~~ RESOLVED  
**Issue**: ~~No HTTPS redirect in production~~ HTTPS is now enforced  
**Action Completed**:
- [x] Added HTTPS redirect logic in middleware for production
- [x] HSTS header already configured in next.config.ts (31536000 seconds = 1 year)
- [x] Configured secure cookies in middleware:
  - secure: true in production
  - httpOnly: true (prevents JavaScript access)
  - sameSite: 'lax' (CSRF protection)
**Note**: Vercel automatically handles SSL certificates and HTTPS. Our middleware adds an extra layer of protection.

### 16. ~~File Upload Security~~ ✅ COMPLETED
**Severity**: ~~HIGH~~ RESOLVED  
**Location**: Photo analysis feature  
**Issue**: ~~Basic file validation only (client-side)~~ Now has comprehensive server-side validation  
**Risk**: ~~Malicious file upload, XSS via file content, server resource exhaustion~~ Mitigated  
**Action Completed**:
