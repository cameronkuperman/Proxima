# Ask Me More - Debug Information

## Current Issue
When clicking "Ask Me More", the backend returns:
```json
{
  "error": "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'",
  "status": "error"
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Session State Issue
The backend error suggests that when `/api/deep-dive/ask-more` is called, it cannot find the session data. This happens because:
- The session might have been cleared after calling `/api/deep-dive/complete`
- The backend might not be persisting session data properly for post-completion queries

### 2. Request Format
The frontend is sending the correct format:
```json
{
  "session_id": "2d9aedb9-a7b3-4d8e-8f72-f72eb9bfb4b3",
  "current_confidence": 85,
  "target_confidence": 90,
  "user_id": "45b61b67-175d-48a0-aca6-d0be57609383"
}
```

But the console shows additional fields being added (confidence, target) which suggests middleware interference.

### 3. Timing Issue
The flow is:
1. User completes 6 questions
2. `/api/deep-dive/complete` is called → Session might be cleared here
3. User clicks "Ask Me More"
4. `/api/deep-dive/ask-more` is called → Session not found

## Solutions

### Backend Fix Required
The backend needs to:
1. Keep session data available after `/complete` is called
2. Allow `/ask-more` to work on completed sessions
3. Or provide a way to "reopen" a session for additional questions

### Frontend Workarounds
1. **Prevent Complete Until Done**: Don't call `/complete` until user explicitly chooses to finish
2. **Store Session Data**: Keep session data in frontend state
3. **New Session Approach**: Start a fresh deep dive session with context from previous

## Temporary Fix Implemented
- Added better error handling
- Check if session is already finalized before allowing Ask Me More
- Provide clear user feedback when session is closed
