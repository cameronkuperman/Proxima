# Backend Synchronization Summary

## Updates Made to Match Backend Implementation

### 1. Model Updates
- **Primary Deep Dive Model**: Changed from `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free` to `tngtech/deepseek-r1t-chimera:free`
- **Fallback Models**: Now properly implemented for all endpoints
  - Continue: Uses `deepseek/deepseek-chat` as fallback
  - Complete: Uses `google/gemini-2.0-pro` as fallback
  - Start: Has full chain of 4 models with exponential backoff

### 2. Deep Dive Ultra Think
- **Endpoint**: Now correctly calls `/api/deep-dive/ultra-think`
- **Parameter**: Fixed to use `session_id` instead of `deep_dive_id`
- **Response Handling**: Updated to match backend response format:
  - `analysis_tier`
  - `confidence_progression`
  - `total_confidence_gain`
  - `processing_message`
  - `complexity_score`
  - `critical_insights`

### 3. Ask Me More
- **Simplified API**: Removed `previousAnswers` parameter (backend tracks automatically)
- **Target Confidence**: Changed default from 90% to 95% to match backend
- **Max Questions**: Explicitly pass 5 as max questions
- **Session State**: Backend now handles `analysis_ready` state automatically
- **Finalization**: Added support for `should_finalize` flag from backend

### 4. Session State Management
The frontend now works with the backend's three-state system:
- `active` → Questions being asked
- `analysis_ready` → Can complete or ask more questions
- `completed` → Final state (when user explicitly finalizes)

### 5. Error Handling
- All API calls now include proper fallback models
- Better error messages that match backend responses
- Automatic retry with different models on failure

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Deep Dive starts with `tngtech/deepseek-r1t-chimera:free`
- [x] Model fallbacks work when primary fails
- [x] Session remains in `analysis_ready` state after initial completion
- [x] Ask Me More works after analysis completion
- [x] Ultra Think calls correct endpoint with `session_id`
- [x] 5-question limit enforced with proper messaging
- [x] Backend's `should_finalize` flag respected

## Key Differences from Original Implementation

1. **No Manual Session State Tracking**: Backend handles state transitions
2. **Simplified Ask Me More**: Backend tracks Q&A history automatically
3. **Direct Ultra Think Endpoint**: Dedicated endpoint for Deep Dive
4. **Automatic Fallbacks**: Backend handles model failures gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Deploy frontend changes
2. Monitor logs for any model failures
3. Track confidence improvements across different models
4. Gather user feedback on the enhanced flow

The frontend is now fully synchronized with the backend implementation!
